# Package Management
- Use the uv package manager
- Do not track a requirements.txt file, instead use the builtin uv files
- Use "uv add" to add packages
- Use "uv remove" to remove unneeded packages when refactoring code
- Use "uv run" instead of "python" to run files
    - Only use this if the package is no longer used globally
